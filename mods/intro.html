    <h5>Important Learning</h5>
    <p>
      I am a Developer Instructional Designer at Cloudinary. Cloudinary is a
      media cloud service company. We help our customer upload, transform, and
      deliver images and video. Video is becoming increasingly popular for
      everthing from ecommerce to travel and more.

    <p>
      I work a lot with video in my job. In the QU IDN 526, we studied
      cognition. We used a book called Multimedia Learning. This book contains a
      lot of useful information that can help make decisions about how to use
      multimedia for training. It basically summarizes research and then creates
      principle that are helpful in deciding how to use multi media.

    <p>
      For example, the Contiguity Principle states that people "learn better
      when corresponding words and pictures are presented simultaneously rather
      than successively".
    </p>
    <p>
      I think we make a lot of decision in putting together training materials
      and it helps to have principles based on research to back you up.
