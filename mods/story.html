  <p>On March 20<sup>th</sup>, 2020, I returned from a business trip in
  <address>Austin, Texas</address>
  to my house in
  <address>Edmonds, Washington 98020</address>.

  Before I left for Austin, there had been talk of a serious virus that was first
  seen at a hospital in <address>Seattle, WA 98101</address>. There had been a <em>lot of
    politics</em> about the threat of this virus.

    “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China,
    and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.”
    - Donald Trump Jan 22, 2020
  </blockquote>

  By the time I got back home, it was clear,
  at least in my neighborhood that there was a <strong>serious problem</strong>.

  <p>I began my quarnatine. I'm a remote worker so working at home wasn't difficult, but getting
    <abbr>TP</abbr> and bleach did seem to be a big problem. We settled for using
    <dfn>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH</dfn> alcohol wipes instead of bleach.

    Jumping ahead 1 year and 3 months, I am now happy to see that we have a number of
    vaccines that  are <del>available</del> <s>working well</s> <ins>miraculous</ins>. Recent news from the CDC
    confirms that we can get back to <ins>almost</ins> normal:

      COVID-19 vaccines are effective at protecting you from getting sick. Based on what we know about COVID-19
      vaccines, people who have been fully vaccinated can start to do some things that they had stopped doing because of
      the pandemic.
