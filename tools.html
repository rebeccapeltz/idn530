      <h2>Web Accessibility Guidelines</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/"
          >Web Content Accessbility Guidelines (WCAG)</a
        >
        is a list of "Success Criteria" that can help a web page to meet the
        requirements for a web page to be easy to use, even with a disability.
        These requirements are broken down into categories representing 5
        dimensions of accessibility. The list below names the dimensions and
        provides some examples of success criteria in each dimension. The
        Conformance category provides measures that can be use to specify how
        well a web page conforms to the guidelines. The list below is just a
        subset of the complete set of guidelines.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <div id="wcag-perceivable">Perceivable</div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Interactive controls: If non-text content is a control or accepts
              user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose. It's
              possible to make any element clickable, but this may fail this
              guideline.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prerecorded audio or video: An alternative must be supplied in a
              format that conveys the same information, like a transcript.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Operable
          <ul>
            <li>
              Keyboard: All functionality is operable through the keyboard.
            </li>
            <li>
              To prevent seizures: Web pages cannot have flashed that occur more
              than 3 times in a second.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Understandable
          <ul>
            <li>
              Language: The default language of each page can be programatically
              determined.
            </li>
            <li>
              Abbreviations: There must be a mechanism for evaluating all
              abbreviations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Predictable Navigation: The navigation must use the same relative
              order across all pages.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Robust
          <ul>
            <li>
              Assistive devices: Maximize compatibility with assistive devices
              like screen reader. This means don't forget closing braces on HTML
              tags.
            </li>
            <li>
              Status messages: Roles or attributes of elements must be available
              so assistive agents can determine status of elements even if they
              are not in focus.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Conformance
          <ul>
            <li>
              Each website owner compiles a list of guidelines or a given level
              of performance, and the calculates the percentage that have been
              met for that level.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are 3 levels for each of the guidelines, A, AA, and AAA. A
              web page must meet all conformance criteria for a level in order
              to report that level.
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to achieve conformance, it must be true for the whole web
              page. If there is a section that the web page author can't
              control, they need to file a statement of partial conformance.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a web page is part of a series of web pages, they all must
              conform in order for one of them to conform.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Semantics</h2>
      <p>
        The word "semantic" means "meaning". Assistive technologies like screen
        readers rely on textual semantics. The guidelines provide a series of
        terms that can be include in the HTML code to help with interpretation.
        Form input is a place where this is especially important. When a
        developer names an input, it's recommended to name it using these terms.
        The list below shows terms you could use for a person's name.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          name - Full name honorific-prefix - Prefix or title (e.g., "Mr.",
          "Ms.", "Dr.", "Mlle")
        </li>
        <li>
          given-name - Given name (in some Western cultures, also known as the
          first name)
        </li>
        <li>
          additional-name - Additional names (in some Western cultures, also
          known as
        </li>
        <li>middle names, forenames other than the first name)</li>
        <li>
          family-name - Family name (in some Western cultures, also known as the
          last name or surname)
        </li>
        <li>honorific-suffix - Suffix (e.g., "Jr.", "B.Sc.", "MBASW", "II")</li>
        <li>
          nickname - Nickname, screen name, handle: a typically short name used
          instead of the full name
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We'll see examples of the importance of semantics in future modules
        where we look directly at HTML code. Besides the naming of inputs, we'll
        see that the HTML tags we used provide semantic information.
      </p>
      <h2>Tools to Identify Accessibility Problems</h2>
      <p>
        There are many tools that can provide feedback that will let a developer
        know how well they are conforming to the guideslines. We'll look at 4 of
        them here.

      <h2>Experience a Screen Reader</h2>
      <p>
        As we noted in the first module, many Americans have visual disabilities
        and because the web is so visual, you may want to experience for
        yourself interacting with a screen reader.The Mac has a built in screen
        reader. For Windows, you can download and install one.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mac:

        <li>
          The chrome browser offers a

            >screen reader extension</a
          >
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Next Step</h3>
      <p>
        In the next module, we'll look at how to improve accessibility by
        providing good Semantics in HTML.
