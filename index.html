      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The web has become like an online University with courses in every
        discipline. In order to teach effectively, it is necessary to learn and
        follow guidelines set up for web developers in general. If the internet
        is like a highway, and websites are like destinations along the highway,
        a course delivered on a website must meet the standards and laws set
        down to ensure a safe destination.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this course we are going to learn what Web Accessbility is, and why
        it is important to follow web accessbility guidelines when creating
        online learning. By the end of this course you should be able to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Describe the organizations that prescribe web accessibility guidelines
        </li>
        <li>
          Understand the legal ramifications of serving content on a website
          that doesn't follow the guidelines
        </li>
        <li>Provide examples of web accessibility guidelines</li>
        <li>Use tools to measure your web page's accessibility</li>

        <li>Update a web page that has missing web accessbility elements</li>
        <li>
          Use Semantic HTML to create a web page's structure and explain its
          importance in terms of web accessbility and Search Engine Optimization
        </li>
        <li>
          Discover a web page's contrast ratio and determine if it meets Web
          Content Accessbility Guidelines
        </li>
        <li>Use the HTML alt tag to make images accessbile</li>
        <li>Use subtitles and closed captioning to make video accessbile</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This training presents a combination of concepts and code. The more that
        the learner is familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript - the languages of
        web development - the easier it will be to master these concepts.
      </p>

      <h2>What is Web Accessibility</h2>
      <p>
        The term Accessbility, in general, means that people are not excluded
        from taking part in an activity because they are disabled in some
        manner. Disabilities can be visual, aural, musculo-skeletal, cognitive
        or mental. When referring to accessbility on the web, the term is
        translated into creating web pages that can be used efficiently by
        disabled people without them having too provide to much adaptation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The web is an audio visual medium and interaction is provided by
        keyboard, mouse or touch screen. Because content is delivered on the web,
        eLearning instructors need to provide ways for disabled learners, such as those with
         poor vision or hearing, to be gain access. The
        <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/basics/ced/fastfacts.htm"
          >CDC reports
        </a>
        that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Approximately 12 million people 40 years and over in the United States
        have vision impairment, including 1 million who are blind, 3 million who
        have vision impairment after correction, and 8 million who have vision
        impairment due to uncorrected refractive error.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The
        <a
          href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing"
          >US Department of Health and Human Services reports</a
        >
        that
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Approximately 15% of American adults (37.5 million) aged 18 and over
        report some trouble hearing.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        People with certain nerve and musculo-skeletal disabilities are not able
        to operate a mouse or touch device. People with cognitive or mental
        disorders may have difficulty focusing and getting information from
        complex visual/audio prentations that may be served up from a web page.
        Fortunately, they are devices that can help disabled people access
        content on the web. These devices, such as screen readers, often require
        that web pages are coded in a way that enable them to detect what is
        going on in the web page. We'll learn about the guidelines that are
        prescribed to help with these accessibility enabling devices.
      </p>

      <h2>Universal Design and UI/UX</h2>
      <p>

            Universal Design</a
          >
        </dfn>

        is a process for creating products that can be used by all people,
        including those with disabilities.

            UI/UX</a
          >
        </dfn>
        is a process for creating usable web pages and web applications. A usable 
        web application is easy to learn, consistent and efficient. Both of
        these disciplines overlap with Web Accessbility. We can borrow from
        these disciplines to create eLearning web pages that are easy to learn
         for disabled as well as non-disabled students.
      </p>

      <h2>Web Accessbility Guidelines and the Law</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/"
          >Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a
        >, are provided by the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility"
          >W3C (World Wide Web Consortion)</a
        >
        in its Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). Currently the W3C is on
        version 2 of these guidelines and they provide many resources for
        coding, testing and obtaining an accessible web page
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the web providing it's own guidelines, other
        organizations have input:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        The US Departement of Justice provides a
        <a href="https://www.ada.gov/pcatoolkit/chap5toolkit.htm"> toolkit</a>
        to support web creation per the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
        Section 508, which mandates that all federal agencies make websites
        available to people with disabilities. This mandate applies to companies
        and educational institutions that receive federal grant money as well as
        federal workplaces.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        A number of lawsuits have been filed over the years that are related to
        websites that don't provide access for people with disabilities. In
        2008,
        <a
          href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2008/08/target-to-pay-6-million-to-settle-site-accessibility-suit/"
          target="_blank"
        >
          Target
        </a>
        settled a class action lawsuit for $6,000,000. A blind student at UC
        Berkeley was unable to use their website because it did not operate well
        with screen readers. The image tags did not contain the
        <strong><code>alt</code></strong> attribute and therefore there was no
        text explaining what was in the image. Screen readers use the text in
        the alt tag to describe an image to a visually impaired user. There are
        several screen readers available depending on the device you use to
        access the web. The video below gives an example of how one of these
        readers, NVDA, are experienced.

      <p>
        As mentioned, Section 508 can affect many instutitions outside of the US
        Federal Governemnt. The

          >webpage</a
        >
        lists a number of Universities that are challenged for failure to meet
        Web accessbility guidelines. There are legal as well as moral and
        practical reasons for learning the WAI guidelines and how to make your
        web page accessible.

        In the next module, we'll look at the Guidelines and Tools you can use
        to measure your website's adherence to these guidelines.
