    <h1>Accessibility on the Web for eLearning</h1>
    <p>The web has become like an online University with courses in every discipline. In order to teach effectively it is necessary to learn and follow guidelines set up for web developers in general. If the internet is like a highway, and websites are like
        destinations along the highway, a course delivered on a website must meet the standards and laws set down to ensure a safe destination.
    </p>
    <p>In this course we are going to learn what Web Accessbility and why it is important to follow web accessbility guidelines when creating online learning. By the end of this course you should be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Describe Web Accessbility</li>
        <li>Provide reasons why its important to follow web accessbility guidelines</li>
        <li>Describe the organizations that prescribe web accessibility guidelines</li>
        <li>Understand the legal ramifications of serving content on a website that doesn't follow the guidelines</li>
        <li>Provide examples of web accessibility guidelines</li>
        <li>Use tools to measure your web page's accessibility</li>
        <li>Update a web page that has missing web accessbility elements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is Web Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
        The term Accessbility, in general, means that people are not excluded from taking part in an activity because they are disabled in some manner. Disabilities can be visual, aural, musculo-skeletal, cognitive or mental. When referring to accessbility on
        the web, the term translated into creating web pages that can be used efficiently by disabled people without them having to provide to much adpation.
    </p>

    <p>
        The web is an audio visual medium and interaction is provide by keyboard, mouse or touch screen. As content deliverers on the web, eLearning instructors need to provide way for disabilities such as poor vision or hearing to be addressed. The
        <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/basics/ced/fastfacts.htm">CDC reports </a> that:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Approximately 12 million people 40 years and over in the United States have vision impairment, including 1 million who are blind, 3 million who have vision impairment after correction, and 8 million who have vision impairment due to uncorrected refractive
        error.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The <a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing">US Department of Health and Human
      Services reports</a> that </p>
    <blockquote>Approximately 15% of American adults (37.5 million) aged 18 and over report some trouble hearing.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        People with certain nerve and musculo-skeletal disabilities are not able to operate a mouse or touch device. Peoplse with cognitive or mental disorders may have difficulty focusing and getting information from complex visual/audio prentations that may
        be served up from a web page.
    </p>

    <p>For all of the disabilities listed above and others not listed, web accessibility guidelines help to make it possible for information on a web page be made available to all who come to it.
    </p>

    <h2>Universal Design and UI/UX</h2>
    <p><dfn>Universal Design</dfn> is a process for creating products that can be used by all people, including those with disabilities. <dfn>UI/UX is a process for creating usable web pages and web applications.</dfn> This means that they are easy to learn,
        consistent and efficient. Both of these disciplines overlap with Web Accessbility. We can borrow from these disciplines to create eLearning web pages that are easy to learn from for disabled as well as non-disabled students.
    </p>

    <h2>Web Accessbility Guidelines and the Law</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>, are provided by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility">W3C (World Wide Web
      Consortion)</a> in its Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). Currently the W3C is on version 2 of these guidelines and they provide many resources for coding, testing and obtaining an accessible web page
    </p>
    <p>In addition to the web providing it's own guidelines, other organizations have input:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The US Departement of Justice provides a <a href="https://www.ada.gov/pcatoolkit/chap5toolkit.htm">
        toolkit</a> to support web creation per the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
        </li>
        <li>Section 508, which mandates that all federal agencies make websites available to people with disabilities. This applies to companies and educational institutions that receive federal grant money as well as federal workplaces.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>A number of lawsuits have been filed over the years that are related to websites that don't provide access for people with disabilities. In 2008, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2008/08/target-to-pay-6-million-to-settle-site-accessibility-suit/">
      Target
    </a> settled a class action lawsuite for $6,000,000. A blind student at UC Berkeley was unable to use their website because it did not operate well with screen readers. The image tags did not contain the <code>alt</code> attribute and therefore there
        was no text explaining what was in the image. There are several screen readers available depending on the device you use to access the web. The video below gives an example of how one of these readers, NVDA, are experienced.

    <p>As mentioned, Section 508 can affect many instutitions outside of the US Federal Governemnt. The <a href="https://www.d.umn.edu/~lcarlson/atteam/lawsuits.html">webpage</a> lists a number of Universities that are challenged for failure to meet Web
        accessbility guidelines. There are legal as well as moral and practical reasons for learning the WAI guidelines and how to make your web page accessible.

    <p>In the next module, we'll look at the Guidelines and Tools you can use to measure your website's adherence to these guidelines.
